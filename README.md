# Holiday-Assessment
A program for scraping Holidays from [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/) using [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Purpose was to demonstrate use of custom Class functionality, webscraping techniques, and API calls
Leaves quites a bit to be desired, but it mostly works
